### For Teachers

Create a new class and have your students use the generated class ID to log in to your class instance.

The status of your students will update automatically in real-time while you teach. Easily keep track of which students are struggling, which are helping other students and the total comprehension rate.


### For Students

Sign in to the app with Facebook or use your email address to create a new account.

Log in to your class with the class ID provided by your teacher.

If you're struggling at any point during class, just click the big button! You'll automatically be taken to a private chatroom that one of your fellow students will soon join to help you out.

When you're caught up, use the button to head back to the main screen (and get points!).

When one of your classmates is having trouble, a blue button will appear. Click it to enter the private chat with them and give them a hand! You get points for successful help chats.
